Task 06: Deep Fake Interview
This repository documents the process of creating an AI-generated deep fake interview as part of a research task. The goal was to take a textual narrative and transform it into a simulated audio or video interview using free or student-friendly tools.

The interview's subject is a news report on the Syracuse University Women's Basketball team, featuring a fictional news reporter and a sports analyst discussing the team's recent performance and statistics.


The Process
My workflow for this task was broken down into three main phases:

1. Scripting and Narrative Generation:
I began by creating a fictional narrative for the SU Women's Basketball team's 2024-2025 season. I generated my own statistics, including a 22-8 record, key player performance stats for Georgia Woolley (20.5 PPG), and a strong defensive rating (65 points per game allowed). Using an AI model, I then crafted a realistic interview script with a distinct voice for a news reporter and a sports analyst. The prompts were designed to ensure the conversation was natural and data-driven.

2. AI Audio Generation:
With the script complete, I used ElevenLabs, a free-to-use text-to-speech platform, to create the voices. I selected two different voices from the platform's libraryâ€”one professional and direct for the reporter, and another more conversational for the analyst. I fed the respective lines from the script into the tool to generate and download individual audio clips for each line of dialogue.

3. Audio Assembly and Post-Production:
Finally, I used Audacity, a free and open-source audio editor, to assemble the final product. I imported all the individual audio clips and arranged them in the correct conversational sequence. I carefully timed the pauses between each speaker's lines to create a realistic flow. I also added an optional, low-volume background sound effect to simulate a news studio environment. The final project was then exported as a single MP3 file.
